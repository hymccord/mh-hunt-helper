# Contributing

### Number 1 Rule: Keep the PRs small. They should have one and only one purpose. The smaller the better.

## Environment Setup

If you'd like a relatively simple way to set up your own development environment for contributing to this project, here are some instructions using Docker containers.

## Method 1: Docker Compose
1. Clone this repo or fork it and clone your fork. Install Docker (and `docker-compose`)
2. In the new cloned directory, cd into `src` directory, make copies of `.example` files and remove the suffixes on them. Change the following in `config.php` and save:
```php
  $servername = "mhct-db";
  $username = "admin";
  $password = "admin"; // unless you change these, which is more secure
  $dbname = "mhhunthelper";
```
3. CD out to  the root directory, run `docker-compose up -d` (this will take a while as it needs to download the database and images)
4. You should now be able to access the local server via http://127.0.0.1 or http://localhost on your browser, connect to the database via port 3306, and modify the code on your host machine.

To add other databases, uncomment them in `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker-compose up -d` again

## Method 2: Docker Run
1. `docker pull tsitu/mhct-db-docker:latest` - This command takes a while, as it downloads the MHCT DB images.
2. `docker run -p 3306:3306 --name mhct-db -d tsitu/mhct-db-docker` (`-p 3306:3306` is optional but maps the Docker port to your localhost for easy access)
3. `docker pull richarvey/nginx-php-fpm:1.8.2`
4. `docker run -d -e 'GIT_EMAIL=' -e 'GIT_NAME=Your Name' -e 'GIT_USERNAME=' -e 'GIT_REPO=github.com/mh-community-tools/mh-hunt-helper' -e 'GIT_PERSONAL_TOKEN=Long String' -e 'WEBROOT=/var/www/html/src' --name mhct richarvey/nginx-php-fpm:1.8.` - The Git stuff is part of your account. You may want to create a new personal token.
5. `docker exec -it mhct bash` - This gets you a shell inside the server container. You'll need to create and edit `src/config.php` via the `.example` file:
```php
  $servername = "IPADDRESS"; // check via `docker inspect mhct-db` (e.g. 172.17.0.2)
  $username = "admin";
  $password = "admin"; // unless you change these, which is more secure
  $dbname = "mhhunthelper";
```
6. You can now access this at `http://IP/`. IP is found with `docker inspect mhct`. If you're using Docker Toolbox, you may need to use `http://192.168.99.100/` and port forward the guest's port 80 to your host port of choice via VirtualBox.
7. `index.php` is attraction rates, `loot.php` is drop rates. `mhhunthelper` data includes attractions, drops, and some stats.

NOTE: To use the other databases, pull and run them (where `[TAG]` can be `converter` or `mapspotter`):

1. `docker pull tsitu/mhct-db-docker:[TAG]`
2. `docker run -d --name mhct-[TAG] tsitu/mhct-db-docker:[TAG]`

This will start each database in its own container with its own IP address (use `docker inspect` to find it). You will use that IP address in `config.php`. Alternatively you can restore each database from [its backup](https://keybase.pub/devjacksmith/mh_backups/) into your `mhct-db` container.

### When You're Using podman

Podman comes with Fedora-flavored linuxes now as a sort of open-source/community version of Docker. It actually has some advantages we're not going to go into or really take advantage of. As far as we're concerned here it just made the setup a bit tricky to figure out.

You've got two options when deploying in podman - you can deploy things within a pod (a shared namespace, this is technically less resource-intensive) or as individual containers (each their own pods). We have 1-3 mysql databases all wanting to talk on port 3306 otherwise this would be an easy task.

If you want to deploy everything into one pod (this should be the preferred way): `podman pod create --name mhct --share cgroup,ipc,uts` -- by default pods share networking and this will just be a headache we don't want. If you don't do this remove `--pod mhct` from below.

1. Pull your images. Just like above but use `podman` instead of `docker`.
2. `podman run -d --pod mhct --name mhct-nginx -p 32080:80 -e 'GIT_EMAIL=' -e 'GIT_NAME=Your Name' -e 'GIT_USERNAME=' -e 'GIT_REPO=github.com/mh-community-tools/mh-hunt-helper' -e 'GIT_PERSONAL_TOKEN=Long String' -e 'WEBROOT=/var/www/html/src' richarvey/nginx-php-fpm:1.8.` -- note the name change from above. You should also set up the git stuff like above. This maps the webserver port 80 to your local port 32080: http://localhost:32080
3. `podman run -d --pod mhct --name mhct-db -p 3306:3306 tsitu/mhct-db-docker:latest` -- your mhhunthelper database will be on localhost port 3306
4. `podman run -d --pod mhct --name mhct-converter -p 3307:3306 tsitu/mhct-db-docker:converter` -- your mhconverter database is on localhost port 3307
5. `podman run -d --pod mhct --name mhct-converter -p 3308:3306 tsitu/mhct-db-docker:mhmapspotter` -- your mhmapspotter database is on localhost port 3308

When you update your config.php you can't use localhost for the hostname because we wanted to remap those 3306 ports. Find an ip address on your host `ip addr`, `hostname -i`, and a few other commands will help you here. There may be quite a few addresses. Within that nginx container (`podman exec -it mhct-nginx bash`) you can try `curl ip.add.ress:3306`. If you get connection refused try another IP address. You get a different error message if it's working - that's your IP address for the config.php file.

NOTE: If you tried this before a port parameter showed up in config.php.example you will need to add `port=3307;` to any dbo connections you're working with. 3306 is the default so if you're just working with one database you're fine.

If you got your pod all set up you can save it so it can be re-created quickly! `podman generate kube mhct > mhct.yaml` will generate a yaml file **with all your github secrets** so keep it safe. `podman play kube mhct.yaml` will re-create your pod! (minus that config.php file). If you pre-pull images you can be sure to have the most up-to-date ones to build from.
